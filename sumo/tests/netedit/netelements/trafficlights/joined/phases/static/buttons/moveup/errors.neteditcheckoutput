Warning: Missing yellow phase in tlLogic 'J0', program '0' for tl-index 0 when switching to phase 1.
Warning: Missing yellow phase in tlLogic 'J0', program '0' for tl-index 1 when switching to phase 0.
Warning: Program '0' at tlLogic 'J0' is incompatible with logic at junction 'J0' (mutual conflict between link indices 3,7 tl indices 3,7 phase 1).
  To avoid deadlock/collisions, either: rebuild the signal plan with a newer version of netconvert/netedit
  or rebuild the network with option '--tls.ignore-internal-junction-jam' or include the program when building.
